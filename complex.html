         * The base *class* . This is base in the sense that it doesn't depend on anything
         * external to itself. It doesn't need to be mixed in with anything in order to become
         * concrete. Rather other traits could be mixed in with `counter` in order to enrich
         * it or alter it's behaviour.
         *
         * But this is not a class really. I say class just to use a familiar terminology.
         * Rather this is a function that is called whenever a new instance of `counter` is
         * required (class Closure pattern).
         *
         * We are using scoping and closure capabilities of functions to return an interface of
         * functions ({forward, current}) that close over `counter`'s local variables thus
         * effectively creating something like a private state. Calling `counter` is like
         * class instantiation in classical OOP.
         *
         * @param {number} initial
         * @param {number} step
         * @return {Object} A pack of functions that interface with the hidden `c`

            function     inc() { c += step; } // private helper (kinda like a method)

            // returns the public methods. Kinda like a module or interface if you like.
            // in code you can't access `c` or `inc()`. Because they are private within
            // `counter`. You can use `forward` and `current` though since they are returned
            // from the `counter`.

         * present in `this` at call time. It does not override anything enriches the base trait with
         * a new function(fastForward()), provided the base trait satisfies the requirements (defines
         * forward() and current()).
         *

         * Now this one is rather interesting because it (1) modifies the behaviour of it's base trait and
         * (2) accepts some initialization input.
         *
         * (1) bookmark needs to *override* forward() in order to do it's job. This is easily done as you can see.
         * Just return the new forward(). You can call the base.forward() with the correct `this` using this.super().
         * Note that if you call forward() with base (`base.forward()` and not `this.super(base.forward)`, then `this`
         * is not bound correctly inside base.forward() unless , of course, this is what you want.
         *
         * (2) We have to de-couple the two concerns (overriding and parametrization). This results in a function(bookmark)
         * that accepts initialization and then returns a function that override a base trait (function(base)). Second function
         * is the one we are familiar to (returns the interface). This second function is closed over `where` and `whatToDo`.
